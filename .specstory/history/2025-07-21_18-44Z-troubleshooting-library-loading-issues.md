# Troubleshooting library loading issues (2025-07-21 18:44Z)

_**User**_

I have trouble loading the libraries. What happened here?

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the terminal output, I can see the issue. The error shows:

```
> 00~library(data.table)01~
Error: unexpected numeric constant in "00~library(data.table)01"
```

This suggests there are some strange characters or formatting issues in your R code. Let me examine the R Markdown file to see what's happening.

The issue appears to be that you're trying to run R code directly in the terminal, but the code in your R Markdown file has some formatting issues. The error suggests there are strange characters (like `00~` and `01~`) being interpreted as part of the code.

Here are the likely causes and solutions:

1. **You're running R code in the wrong place**: The code in your R Markdown file is meant to be run within RStudio or when knitting the R Markdown document, not directly in the terminal.

2. **Copy-paste issues**: If you copied code from the R Markdown file to the terminal, it may have picked up invisible characters or formatting.

To fix this:

1. **Open RStudio** and run your code there instead of the terminal
2. **Or use R directly** by typing `R` in the terminal first, then running:
   ```r
   library(dplyr)
   library(data.table)
   ```

3. **If you need to run the R Markdown file**, use:
   ```bash
   Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('GWP_cleaningCode_myanmar.rmd')"
   ```

The error `00~library(data.table)01~` suggests there are invisible characters or formatting artifacts in your code. Try running the libraries one at a time in a clean R session to isolate the issue.

This happens in a regular .R file also

I see the issue now. The problem is that you're getting strange characters like `00~` and `01~` in your R code, which suggests there might be invisible Unicode characters or encoding issues in your files.

Let me check your Testing.R file to see what's happening:


---

Read file: Testing.R

The Testing.R file looks normal. The issue is likely that you're copying and pasting code from somewhere that has invisible Unicode characters or formatting artifacts. Here are a few solutions:

1. **Type the commands manually** instead of copy-pasting:
   ```r
   library(styler)
   ```

2. **Check for invisible characters** by running this in R:
   ```r
   charToRaw("library(styler)")
   ```

3. **Clean your R session** and try again:
   ```r
   rm(list = ls())
   library(styler)
   ```

4. **If you're copying from a web browser**, try:
   - Copy to a plain text editor first (like Notepad/TextEdit)
   - Then copy from there to R
   - Or use `Ctrl+Shift+V` (or `Cmd+Shift+V` on Mac) for "paste as plain text"

5. **Check your R console encoding**:
   ```r
   Sys.getlocale("LC_CTYPE")
   ```

The `00~` and `01~` characters suggest there might be some kind of formatting or encoding issue. Try typing the library command manually to see if that works.

THis is the encoding result

_**Assistant**_

The encoding looks fine (`en_US.UTF-8` is standard). The issue is likely that you're copying code from somewhere that has invisible Unicode characters or formatting artifacts.

Try this to diagnose the problem:


---

```bash
cd /Users/phyllislun/Documents/GitHub/Myanmar && R --version
```

```
phyllislun@MacBook-Air-434 Myanmar % cd /Users/phyllislun/Documents/GitHub/Myanmar && R --version   c
d /Users/phyllislun/Documents/GitHub/Myanmar && R --version
R version 4.5.1 (2025-06-13) -- "Great Square Root"

Now let's test if the issue is with copy-pasting by typing the command manually:


---

```bash
R --slave -e "library(styler)"
```

```
phyllislun@MacBook-Air-434 Myanmar % R --slave -e "library(styler)"
```

---

Good! The `library(styler)` command works fine when run directly. The issue is definitely with copy-pasting from your source.

**Solutions:**

1. **Type commands manually** in R console instead of copy-pasting

2. **Use a plain text editor** as an intermediary:
   - Copy your code to TextEdit/Notepad
   - Then copy from there to R

3. **Use RStudio** instead of terminal R - it handles copy-paste better

4. **Check what you're copying** by pasting into a text editor first to see if there are strange characters

5. **If copying from a web browser**, try:
   - `Cmd+Shift+V` (paste as plain text)
   - Or copy to a text editor first

The `00~` and `01~` characters suggest there are invisible Unicode characters in your copied text. This often happens when copying from rich text sources (like Word documents, web pages, or PDFs).
